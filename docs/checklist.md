# New Team, New Coach Guide

This guide is designed to help the absolute beginner head coach keep tabs on everything they need to keep tabs on.

It assumes the following:

* You have a basic understanding of what FRC is *(A robotics program)* and what you expect to get out of it. *(A set of students motivated to go into stem)*
* Your team has almost zero experience in any of the FIRST programs (FLL, FTC, FRC). More experienced teams probably won't find the guide particularly useful.

    * Can they code a drivable robot?
    * Have you established the drive station
