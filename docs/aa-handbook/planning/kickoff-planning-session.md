# Kickoff Day Planning

### DEFINE

1. Introduction
    * Define the game
    * List out the functions of the robot

2. Requirements? Constraints? Define the game.
    * What types of game pieces are there? How many are there?
    * How many game pieces is a robot allowed to hold?        
    * What are the zones on the field?
    * What type of navigational obstructions may be on the field?
    * What can the robot interact with on the field? -- this should be everything
    * What ways can you score?
    * At what rate can can you score during teleop? (if there are multiple methods, list each)
    * How many points are likely to come from each type of scoring opportunity?     
    * How are rank points scored?
    * How many rank points total can you get?    
    * Do any type of rank points require more than one robot to achieve?     
    * How can you prevent your opponent from scoring. (even if we don't do this, we need to plan against it)
    * What types of penalities are going to be significant in this game?
    * Where do the robots start on the field?
    * How long does it take to complete the "end" challenge (typically a climb, but not always)
    * How much more are points in auto worth than robo?
    * Are certain parts of the field easier to score from than others?
    * Are some parts of the field going to be hard to see from?
    * Are there any chokehold strategies, or a strategy that insures your team will absolutely win? What rules prevent this?
    * Are there any situations where you may have to choose between a bonus ranking point and winning a qualification match?
    * List one insight you think your peers might have missed. Explain in detail.
     
3. List out the each of the functions that the robot will have to perform. This can be done as simply as just trying to play with a student as a robot.    
    * Drive based on preset program
    * Drive based on user input
    * Pick up game piece
    * Deliver game piece
    * Climb    

### IDEATE - (not at kickoff)

### CREATE 

### Building

This means generally solving the problem before you put it together physically
    I think it means designing the tool with the end in mind: It should clamp with X amount of force. It should extend X feet.

### SOLVE


* What do we need to figure out?

* What do we want to learn?
    * To what level, and how to do we want to compete?
    * How many points do we need to score to do that?

* Do we want to design something completely on our own?

* What are the requirements to do the above?
    * What do we need to learn?
    * How many hours will it take?
