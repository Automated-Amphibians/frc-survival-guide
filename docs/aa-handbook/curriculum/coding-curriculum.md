## Basics

### Computer Basics
* Understand what a console is
* Understand what a file/folder is
* Understand what a compiler, interpreter - machine code (interpreter, code that is interpreter and run on the fly)
    * Understand that compilers let you do some basic checks of your code before you use it


### Java Fundamentals
* Know the structure of Java application/programs.

    libraries - "folders/jar"
        packages - "folder of java source code files"
            classes - "found in source code file"
                methods - "groups of statements"
                    statements - an instruction, or group of instructions terminated by a semicolon                

* Understand different types of java variables, double, float, int, String
* Understand basics of lexical scope, class, method
* Understand how variables are passed as copy/reference
* Understand different operators =,==, !=, &&, +-/*
* Understand basic looping
* Understand how to output to the console
* Understand how to passing parameters (copy vs. reference)
* Understanding classes/packages
    * Packages are grouped by types of functionality
* Understand what java tooling is
    * Java only contains the absolute most basic tools to compile individual files into classes, bundle them up, some debugging capability
    * Everything else is autocomplete, gradle, debugging to source

### GIT
* Understand how to use GIT, cloning, creating a branch, pushing to a branch -- ideally merging eventually, but not immediately

### FRC and Java
* Understand what WPILib is:         
    * Provides Visual Studio - with many, many configurations already provided. Java editor bindings, a menu system to kick off gradle tasks        
    * Provides Java
    * Provides Gradle
    * A set of java applications that assist in the development of robot programs (robot app generator, simulator)
* WPILib is also an advanced set of gradle tasks that:
    * Kick off earlier mentioned robot project related applications
    * Reconfigure the current gradle project
    * Deploy to your Roborio 
* Generate a java application with advanced tooling, specifically gradle, but it also         
* Simulate your robot environment in a virtual environment
