* WPILib is also an advanced set of gradle tasks that:
    * Kick off earlier mentioned robot project related applications
    * Reconfigure the current gradle project
    * Deploy to your Roborio 
* Generate a java application with advanced tooling, specifically gradle, but it also         
* Simulate your robot environment in a virtual environment
