### Computer Basics
* Understanding binary, the language of computer computation and memory
    * Everything is 0's and 1's, counting in binary
    * How does a computer store letters?
    * How do you get floating points?
    * Complications, aka, things we aren't going to cover
        * Addition, subtraction, multiplication
        * [twos complement](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~tomf/notes/cps104/twoscomp.html)
    

* Understand how the command line works
    * What is a profile?
    * What are environment variables?    
* Understand what a file/folder structure is.
* Understand what a compiler, interpreter - machine code (interpreter, code that is interpreter and run on the fly)
    * Understand that compilers let you do some basic checks of your code before you use it
        

### GIT
* Undestanding Operating Systems
    * A quick overview of the operating systems that matter
        * Linux is an operating system, Ubuntu, Debian, Arch are distributions
    * Looking at processes
    * A much closer look at file systems
* Understand how to use GIT: 
    * Cloning, branching, pushing and pulling from branch (remotely too), diff and merging along with conflicts    

### Java Fundamentals
* Know the structure of Java application/programs, from library on down to statements
* Understand different types of java variables, double, float, int, String
* Understand basics of scope: lexical (class vs. method)
* Understand different operators =,==, !=, &&, +-/*
* Calling methods
* Understand basic looping
* Understand how to output to the console
* Understand how variables are passed as copy vs. reference
* Understand how different variables are stored in memory
* Understanding classes/packages
    * Packages are grouped by types of functionality
* Understand what java tooling is
    * Java only contains the absolute most basic tools to compile individual files into classes, bundle them up, some debugging capability
    * Everything else is autocomplete, gradle, debugging to source
* Naming Conventions
* The basics of inheritance and interfaces


### FRC and Java
* Understand what WPILib is:         
    * Provides Visual Studio - with many, many configurations already provided. Java editor bindings, a menu system to kick off gradle tasks        
    * Provides Java
    * Provides Gradle
    * A set of java applications that assist in the development of robot programs (robot app generator, simulator)
* WPILib is also an advanced set of gradle tasks that:
    * Kick off earlier mentioned robot project related applications
    * Reconfigure the current gradle project
    * Deploy to your Roborio 
* Generate a java application with advanced tooling, specifically gradle, but it also         
* Simulate your robot environment in a virtual environment
